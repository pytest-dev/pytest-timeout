pytest-timeout
==============

This is a plugin which will terminate tests after a certain timeout.
When doing so you will get a stack dump of all threads running at the
time.  This is useful when e.g. running tests under a continuous
integration (CI) server.


Usage
-----

Install is as simple as e.g.::

   pip install pytest-timeout

By default the plugin will not time out any tests, to enable timeouts
you need to set a timeout using either the command line option
``--timeout=N`` or using the likewise named configuration option in
e.g. pytest.ini (see py.test docs for other files considered as
configuration files)::

   [pytest]
   timeout = N

In both cases *N* is an integer number indicating the number of
seconds before a timeout will occur.  Using a timeout of ``0`` will
result in no timeout, but will enable the plugin so you can use the
marker (see below).

Furthermore it is possible to change the default timeout method used
by the plugin using ``timeout_method`` as either a long option
(prefixed with ``--``) or in the configuration file.  Valid values are
"signal" and "thread", details of their behaviour and implications can
be found below in the "How it Works" section.  Normally there is no
need to worry about this however as the default will be fine.

When the plugin is enabled by the command line option or configuration
file item you can control it's behaviour on a per-test level using the
*timeout* marker, e.g.::

   @pytest.mark.timeout(5)
   def test_foo():
       pass

will set the timeout to 5 seconds for the test.  The marker can also
specify the method used for a test using the ``method`` keyword::

   @pytest.mark.timeout(method='thread')
   def test_foo():
       pass

This can be useful if you have a particular test who's code does
conflict with the use of SIGALRM by this plugin.  You can of course
modify both the timeout and marker at the same time::

   @pytest.mark.timeout(5, method='signal')
   def test_foo():
       pass


How It Works
------------

This plugin works in one of two ways.  If the system supports the
SIGALRM signal an alarm will be scheduled when a test starts and
cancelled when it finishes.  If the alarm expires during the test the
signal handler will use `pytest.fail()` to interrupt the test after
having dumped the stack of any other threads running to stderr.

If the system does not support SIGALRM or the "thread" timeout method
was selected then a timer thread will be used instead.  Once more, if
this timer is not cancelled before it expires it will dump the stack
of all threads to stderr before terminating the entire py.test process
using os._exit(1).

The downside of the SIGALRM method is that the signal is used by the
test framework.  If this signal is used by the code under test you
will need to use the "thread" timeout method.  The limitation of the
timer thread however is the extra overhead of creating a thread for
each executed test and the fact that after one timeout the entire
process is stopped and no further tests are executed.


Changelog
---------

0.3dev
~~~~~~

* Added the PYTEST_TIMEOUT environment variable as a way of specifying
  the timeout (closes issue #2).

* More flexible marker argument parsing: you can now specify the
  method using a positional argument.


0.2
~~~

* Add a marker to modify the timeout delay using a @pytest.timeout(N)
  syntax, thanks to Laurant Brack for the initial code.

* Allow the timeout marker to select the timeout method using the
  ``method`` keyword argument.

* Rename the --nosigalrm option to --method=thread to future proof
  support for eventlet and gevent.  Thanks to Ronny Pfannschmidt for
  the hint.

* Add ``timeout`` and ``timeout_method`` items to the configuration
  file so you can enable and configure the plugin using the ini file.
  Thanks to Holger Krekel and Ronny Pfannschmidt for the hints.

* Tested (and fixed) for python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.
